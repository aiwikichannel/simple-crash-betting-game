# simple-crash-betting-game
Very simple python script for the betting game crash

# INSTALL INSTRUCTONS

1. Create a new environment to run the Python script in.

To start a new virtual environment in the shell, you can follow these steps:

    1. Open the shell or terminal.
    2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment (if necessary).
    3. Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:
       - On Windows:
         ```
         python -m venv crashgame
         ```
       - On macOS and Linux:
         ```
         python3 -m venv crashgame
         ```
    4. Once the command finishes executing, you can activate the virtual environment:
       - On Windows:
         ```
         crashgame\Scripts\activate
         ```
       - On macOS and Linux:
         ```
         source crashgame/bin/activate
         ```
    5. After activating the virtual environment, you should see the virtual environment's name in the shell prompt. You can now install packages and run Python scripts within this isolated environment without       affecting the system-wide Python installation. This script does not require any additional Python packages. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED PLEASE INSTALL IT HERE: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. The last step is to run, 'python crashgame.py', in the shell to start the app. It is very basic but feel free to build upon it as I plan to as well!
